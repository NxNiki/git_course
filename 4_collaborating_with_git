# create a new repo:
git init mental-health-workspace

# avoid nested repos. this will create two .git directories

# if you already in the directory of a project and want to create a repo based in it:
git init

# remote repos

git clone path-to-project-directory

git clone /home/john/repo
git clone /home/john/repo new_repo

# clone a remote:
git clone https://github.com/datacamp/project

# git remebers where the original repo was and stores a remote tag in the new repo's configuration
# list the name of remotes of a repo (in the repo directory):
git remote

git remote -v #verbose

# add more remotes by specifying a name for git to assign:
git remote add george https://github.com/george_datacamp/repo

# add name to remote repo (stored locally but not in the current directory)
git remote add john /home/john/repo

# gathering from remote (get content from remote to local repo)

# to compare files in a remote against contents in local repo, we need to fetch versions of remote.
git fetch origin main

# fetch into a different branch:
git fetch origin report

# synchronizing content between local's main branch and remote:
git merge origin main # orgin is the remote, main is local

# fast-forward mean local repo is behind the remote.

# remote is often ahead of local repo, fetch and merge is a common workflow, this is simplified by pulling from remote
git pull origin main

# it's important to save our work locally before we pull from remote.

# push to remote
git push origin main
