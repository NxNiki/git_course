Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:
- Modified: the file is changed but not committed to your database yet.
- Staged: you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- Committed: the data is safely stored in your local database.


`git diff`: compares the working directory (Modified) with the staging area (Staged).

`git diff --staged`: compares your staged changes to your last commit.

`git commit -a -m 'Add new benchmarks'`: commit without adding files to the staging area.

`git rm <file>`: remove the file from the working directory. You will be able to commit this change. If you run `rm <file>`, the change is not added to the staging area.

`git rm -f <file>`: remove the modified file or file in the staging area.

`git rm --cached <file>`: remove files from the staging area but keep them in the working directory (hard drive).

`git mv <file1> <file2>`: rename <file1> to <file2>

`git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph`: show commit history.

`git log -S <function_name>`: show commits that changed <function_name>.

`git log -- <path/to/file>`: show commits that changed the file.

### undo changes:

`git commit --amend`: commit files in the staging area and overwrite the last commit message.
> Only amend commits that are still local and have not been pushed somewhere.

`git reset HEAD <file_name>`: discard changes added to the staging area.

`git checkout -- <file_name>`: discard changes in the modified file.
> `git checkout -- <file>` is a dangerous command. Any local changes you made to that file are gone — Git just replaced that file with the last staged or committed version.

> Anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered. Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an --amend commit.
